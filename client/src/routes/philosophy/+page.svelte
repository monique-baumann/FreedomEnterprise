		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To "Regulators"</h4>
		Please think for yourself about the following while you go for a walk offline: The crimes of the
		"governments" you worked for, seem much more dangerous to humanity than the crimes which abuse freedom
		and privacy of money. We believe in peace over war. We believe in freedom over totalitarianism. We
		believe in reasonable good police officers over kyc and total surveillance. We believe in free humans.
		You have proved that all your kyc, censorship, propaganda and visions of totalitarian state money
		called CBDC do not succeed. Even if you do not fully understand how we solve things yet, even if
		you do not like us, even if you cannot feel the hearts of free humans in your heart, we invite you
		to join us, learn with us, help us and enjoy also the technical pulses of freedom block by block
		by block by block by block by block by block by block by block

		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To Mass Media People</h4>
		We know it is tough for some of you to earn a living and even harder to become free. We encourage
		you to foster your interest for real, free and brave journalism again. Why do you accept that the
		best of your colleagues are in prison? We believe you can do better than that. We invite you to invest
		and talk about Freedom Cash. Please stop spreading divide and conquer propaganda. Feel free to join
		us.

		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To Politicians</h4>
		Please relax, go for a walk and decide wisely if you would like to be a part of the problem or a
		part of the solution.<br />
		Many of you might be victims of their own former "success" causing you to think and feel in old divide
		and conquer propaganda patterns. What you perceived as success at that time might turn out to be
		rather the opposite. <br />
		It seems some of you tried to prevent honorable, fair, respectful people from being free.<br />
		This seems not very nice of you. <br />
		Please stop trying to divide and conquer. Please stop trying to make people angry at each other.
		<br />
		Please do not try to associate us with any group of people which you prepared to be disliked by your
		mainstream believers. <br />
		Please do not infiltrate our Freedom Lover community with your bad actors. <br />
		Maybe no one told you in your life: Please treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself.
		<br />

		We will need to finance with taxes only those of you who actually represent our free will.
		<br />
		If you do not like to represent the free will of free, reasonable people, you might reconsider your
		career decisions. <br />
		If you are interested in freedom, fairness love and peace and with that in our everyone's wellbeing,
		please join us and help us to pave the way into <br />
		<a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank">real democracy</a>.

		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To Everyone</h4>
		If we do not own freedom, what do we own?<br />
		It seems to be a good idea to own freedom again and to support people who encourage <br />
		<a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank">real democracy</a>. <p><br></p> Totalitarian
		Internationalsocialism disguised as democracy is about to come to an end anyways. <br />

	<h4>Freedom Lovers</h4>
	
	We are not left or right.<br />
	We are humans.
	<p><br /></p>
	We do not divide and conquer.<br />
	We love and invite.
	<p><br /></p>
	We are not good or bad.<br />
	We are as good as we can.
	<p><br /></p>
	We are not rich or poor.<br />
	We are as rich as we deserve to be by being fair.
	<p><br /></p>
	We are not nationalists or international socialists.<br />
	We support freedom for everyone who supports freedom for everyone.
	<p><br /></p>
	We do not exclude anyone who treats everyone with fairness and respect.<br />
	We invite everyone to join us early.
	<p><br /></p>
	
	
	
	<h4>Potential Weak Spots</h4>
	Weak spots of our endeavors in freedom, fairness, love and peace seem to be:<br />
	We do not know if corrupt central actors might still have a chance in launching a 51 percent attack
	on the Ethereum Blockchain. <br />
	They also might try to criminalize owners of own money. They were stupid and or corrupt enough
	to ignore that
	<b>Privacy is Not a Crime</b> when they tried to censor privacy transactions on the Ethereum
	blockchain like those interacting with privacy protocols like Tornado Cash. International
	socialists might learn that Privacy is Not a Crime, Journalism is Not a Crime and
	<b>Freedom is Not a Crime</b>.
	<p><br></p>
		
	If corrupt international socialists try to criminalize some of us for owning our own money by making up any crime stories like they probably
	did with Andrew Tate, we hope that there will be outrages like those which will lead to the release
	of brave journalists like Julian Assange. So the weakest weak spot migh be a huge amount of potentially ignorant 
	people who rather hide behind their "weakness" instead of investing into freedom. 
	<p><br /></p>
	
	<h4 class="text-center">Our Wish</h4>
	May everyone who reads this with the best of intentions always have enough Freedom Cash stored within
	self hosted paperwallets which shall be utilized for fruitful, respectful and fair exploration of truth and peer
	to peer collaboration. Please make Freedom Cash an homage to all who play for freedom and invest
	some Finney right now. Start small and talk about Freedom. We wish you all the best.
	<p><br /></p>

	
	<h4>Contact</h4>
	<p><br /></p>
	We do not believe in centralized responsibles. Therefore we do not recommend specific people as contact
	persons.
	<p><br /></p>
	In this respect the smart contract is your point of smart contact. Read it.
	<p><br /></p>
	Please avoid interacting with scammers and impersonators. Everyone might be in The A-Team.
	<p><br /></p>
	This is a community project which shall empower people. With power comes responsibility.
	Please understand that you are alone responsible for your private keys and for making sure that you
	interact with the correct smart contract and that you understand the smart contract. You alone are responsible 
	for all of your actions. This dApp page is associated with timestamp: timestampOfBuild.
