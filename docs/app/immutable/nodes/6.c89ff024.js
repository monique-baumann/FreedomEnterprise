		Please think for yourself about the following while you go for a walk offline: The crimes of the
		&quot;governments&quot; you worked for, seem much more dangerous to humanity than the crimes which abuse freedom
		and privacy of money. We believe in peace over war. We believe in freedom over totalitarianism. We
		believe in reasonable good police officers over kyc and total surveillance. We believe in free humans.
		You have proved that all your kyc, censorship, propaganda and visions of totalitarian state money
		called CBDC do not succeed. Even if you do not fully understand how we solve things yet, even if
		you do not like us, even if you cannot feel the hearts of free humans in your heart, we invite you
		to join us, learn with us, help us and enjoy also the technical pulses of freedom block by block
		by block by block by block by block by block by block by block

		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To Mass Media People</h4>
		We know it is tough for some of you to earn a living and even harder to become free. We encourage
		you to foster your interest for real, free and brave journalism again. Why do you accept that the
		best of your colleagues are in prison? We believe you can do better than that. We invite you to invest
		and talk about Freedom Cash. Please stop spreading divide and conquer propaganda. Feel free to join
		us.

		<h4 class="text-center">Our Message To Politicians</h4>
		Please relax, go for a walk and decide wisely if you would like to be a part of the problem or a
		part of the solution.<br/>
		Many of you might be victims of their own former &quot;success&quot; causing you to think and feel in old divide
		and conquer propaganda patterns. What you perceived as success at that time might turn out to be
		rather the opposite. <br/>
		It seems some of you tried to prevent honorable, fair, respectful people from being free.<br/>
		This seems not very nice of you. <br/>
		Please stop trying to divide and conquer. Please stop trying to make people angry at each other.
		<br/>
		Please do not try to associate us with any group of people which you prepared to be disliked by your
		mainstream believers. <br/>
		Please do not infiltrate our Freedom Lover community with your bad actors. <br/>
		Maybe no one told you in your life: Please treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself.
		<br/>

		We will need to finance with taxes only those of you who actually represent our free will.
		<br/>
		If you do not like to represent the free will of free, reasonable people, you might reconsider your
		career decisions. <br/>
		If you are interested in freedom, fairness love and peace and with that in our everyone&#39;s wellbeing,
		please join us and help us to pave the way into <br/> <a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank">real democracy</a>.

		If we do not own freedom, what do we own?<br/>
		It seems to be a good idea to own freedom again and to support people who encourage <br/> <a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank">real democracy</a>. <p><br/></p> Totalitarian
		Internationalsocialism disguised as democracy is about to come to an end anyways. <br/> <p><br/></p>
