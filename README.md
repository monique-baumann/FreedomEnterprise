# Freedom Enterprise
I've been working on a new electronic enterprise system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.   

The Freedom Enterprise uses [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org) ([see scan](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/token/0xa1e7bB978a28A30B34995c57d5ba0B778E90033B)) as its decentralized currency.  

The smart contract of the Freedom Enterprise will be completed and deployed together with its distributed app once at least one of the following conditions are true:  
1. [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org) has at least 9000 holders  
2. It is March 12th of 2024 in Switzerland

## Usage Example

```ts
deno run --allow-all ./usage-example.ts
```

## Execute Usage Example

```sh
deno run --allow-all ./usage-example.ts
```

## Usage Example Client
There shall be many trustworthy frontends for the Freedom Enterprise.  
Programmers will be able to integrate Freedom Enterprise as svelte, angular or vue component starting on March 2024.

## Donations
Thanks to [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org), we are already free.  
If you want to donate, you might consider donating to the [otherparty.co.uk](https://www.otherparty.co.uk/donate-crypto-the-other-party) to ensure people do not need to donate to victims but rather donate successfully to problem solvers.
