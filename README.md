electronic enterprise system that's fully peer-to-peer

## Announcement
I've been working on a new electronic enterprise system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party...   

The Freedom Enterprise will use [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org) ([see scan](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/token/0xa1e7bB978a28A30B34995c57d5ba0B778E90033B)) as its decentralized currency.  

The smart contract of the Freedom Enterprise will be published together with its distributed app once at least one of the following conditions are true:  
1. [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org) has at least 9000 holders  
2. It is March 12th of 2024 in Switzerland

## Donations
Thanks to [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org), we are already free.  
If you want to donate, you might consider donating to the [otherparty.co.uk](https://www.otherparty.co.uk/donate-crypto-the-other-party) to ensure people do not need to donate to victims but rather donate successfully to problem solvers.
